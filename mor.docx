<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>

<h3>Chapter Summary: What is Morphology?</h3>

<p><strong>Morphology Overview:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Morphology is the study of word formation, encompassing the creation of new words and variations in word forms based on their usage in sentences.</li>
    <li>Native speakers intuitively understand how to form new words and recognize unfamiliar words.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Word Formation Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Examples like "splatz" (verb for 'step on broken glass') illustrate intuitive knowledge of word formation.</li>
    <li>Suffixes like -ize (crystallize) and -ify (codify) are used to create verbs from nouns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Intuitive Knowledge:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Native speakers possess intuitive knowledge of word formation principles, even if they can't explicitly articulate them.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Simple and Complex Words:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Words can be simple (one morpheme) or complex (multiple morphemes).</li>
    <li>Morpheme definition: the smallest unit of language with its own meaning.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Counting Words:</h3>
<p>Different ways to count words: tokens (individual occurrences), types (unique words), and lexemes (word families).</p>

<p><strong>Lexeme Formation:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Morphology serves to form new lexemes from existing ones, involving changes in part of speech or the addition of substantial meaning.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inflection:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Inflectional word formation doesn't create new lexemes but alters grammatical forms to fit different contexts.</li>
    <li>English has relatively limited inflection compared to other languages.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Types of Lexeme Formation:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Category-changing lexeme formation (e.g., V→N, N→A).</li>
    <li>Meaning-changing lexeme formation (e.g., A→'negative A', N→'place where N lives').</li>
    <li>Both category and meaning-changing lexeme formation (e.g., V→A, N→V).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why Languages Have Morphology:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Morphology serves purposes like lexeme formation and inflection to efficiently express a wide range of concepts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Book Organization:</h3>
<p>Subsequent chapters will delve into questions about what constitutes a "real" word, different ways lexemes are formed, inflection, typology, and the relationship between morphology, syntax, and phonology.</p>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Morphology studies words, their formation, and the rules governing their structure and meaning.</p>
